# School Project: Pizza Shop Database
This project was created as an assignment for my systems design class as part of my Management Information Systems degree. The work product represents an end-to-end system design / Software Developement lifecycle project from requirements gathering, to L0-L1-L2 data flow diagramming, and ultimate the creation of a backend database and various form-based UIs for CRUD operations. We got an A so that's what matters...
